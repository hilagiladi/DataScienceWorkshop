Additionally, as general health status declines from excellent to poor, there's a steady increase in heart disease prevalence regardless of activity level. This pattern is particularly dramatic in the poor health category, where rates jump to over 30%.

In contrast, those experiencing the most health challenges (over 15 days of both physical and mental health issues) show the highest rate at 24.4%. The correlation appears stronger with physical health issues, as seen by larger jumps in heart disease rates when physical health days increase, which aligns with the correlation matrix showing physical health had a stronger correlation (0.17) with heart disease compared to mental health (0.03).

Across all racial groups, there are several consistent patterns: individuals with heart disease (brown) tend to be concentrated in the older age ranges (50-80 years), while those without heart disease (blue) show a wider age distribution starting from younger ages (20-80 years). The distributions are relatively similar across racial groups, though the White population shows the largest sample size as indicated by the width of the violin plot. Asian and American Indian/Alaskan Native groups show slightly more compressed age distributions, due to smaller sample sizes. The plot's focus on individuals with less than 6 hours of sleep is interesting, though the correlation matrix showed sleep time had a negligible correlation (0.01) with heart disease, suggesting that sleep duration alone may not be a strong predictor of heart disease. Similarly, race showed a weak negative correlation (-0.04) with heart disease, indicating that racial differences may not be strongly associated with heart disease risk when controlling for other factors.",
